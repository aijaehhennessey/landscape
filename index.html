  <h1> Artist Description:
    <p>
  The original painting, "North Head from above Balmoral, Sydney Harbour" (1866) was done by English Australian watercolor painter Conrad Martens.
  <p>
  This is a very detailed painting but also represents a very colonial perspective that did not respect the land or its Indigenous inhabitants.
  <p>
  My re-interpretation of this painting focused on the basic shapes and colors to convey the base energy but incorporates the colors/ pattern of the Aboriginal flag.
<p>
  This is meant to speak to the fact that Australia is stolen land and despite colonial processes, will always be native land with Indigenous peoples.
